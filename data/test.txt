Quantum computing in a nutshell¶
Quantum computing represents a new paradigm in computation that utilizes the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. If you are reading this then you have undoubtedly heard that the promise of quantum computation lies in the possibility of efficiently performing a handful of tasks such as prime factorization, quantum simulation, search, optimization, and algebraic programs such as machine learning; computations that at size are beyond the capabilities of even the largest of classical computers.

The power of quantum computing rests on two cornerstones of quantum mechanics, namely interference and entanglement that highlight the wave- and particle-like aspects of quantum computation, respectively. Qiskit is an SDK for performing quantum computations that utilize these quantum mechanical principles using the language of quantum circuits. Comprised of quantum gates, instructions, and classical control logic, quantum circuits allow for expressing complex algorithms and applications in a abstract manner that can be executed on a quantum computer. At its core, Qiskit is a quantum circuit construction, optimization, and execution engine. Additional algorithm and application layers leverage quantum circuits, often in concert with classical computing resources, to solve problems in optimization, quantum chemistry, physics, machine learning, and finance. In what follows, we give a very brief overview of quantum computing, and how Qiskit is used at each step. Interested readers are directed to additional in-depth materials for further insights.

Interference¶
Like a classical computer, a quantum computer operates on bits. However, while classical bits can only be found in the states 0 and 1, a quantum bit, or qubit, can represent the values 0 and 1, or linear combinations of both. These linear combinations are known as superpositions (or superposition states).

To see how this resource is utilized in quantum computation we first turn to a classical analog: noise cancellation. Noise cancellation, as done in noise cancelling headphones for example, is performed by employing superposition and the principle of interference to reduce the amplitude of unwanted noise by generating a tone of approximately the same frequency and amplitude, but out of phase by a value of 
 (or any other odd integer of 
).
